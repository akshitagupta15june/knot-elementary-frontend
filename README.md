## Inspiration
We were inspired by our teammate Emma's experience as an elementary school teacher and how this app or the existence of something like it may have simplified her life. Also, two of our members (Mike and Akshita) are currently at university and our personal experiences flowed through the entire project. With such a strong background in academia (a shared experience), we were able to **pull** this project from ideation to fruition.

## What it does

Welcome to Knot-Elementary, the ultimate tool for managing your child's academic life with ease. With our platform, you can authorize different roles to ensure that every stakeholder is on the same page. Our meeting scheduling feature makes it simple to coordinate parent-teacher conferences, while our view child grades option lets you monitor your child's academic performance in real-time. With admin access, you can easily manage your child's academic records and make updates as needed. Plus, our read/write feature allows you to communicate with teachers and school administrators directly from the platform. Sign up for Knot-Elementary today and take part in your child's academic journey!

After getting authenticated, our database determines your role (either **admin**, **teacher**, or **parent**). Each user role starts somewhere different and has permission granted and revoked.

## 🛠️ How we built it 🛠️

➡️We built the front end with **React⚛️** and React-specific dependencies, such as __Flowbite-react__, __react-helmet__,  __bootstrap-react__,  __react-icons__, and __React-router__ / __react-router-dom__.

➡️The styling was done with **Tailwind CSS🌊** and **CSS3🟦**. The backend was done with **PostgreSQL🐘** and **Express🔙☕📜**. 

➡️We used **Auth-0⬛⭐** for authentication and hosted the project with **Render**.

## 😵‍💫 Challenges we ran into 😓

__Auth0__ Integration, routing, design, time-zone conflicts. Slight version control, as we decided to push all our personal changes to one repository branch was not wise, so we either forked, cloned, or made our contribution on our own personal testing environments. Hooray for 🌟**version control**!🎊

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The database took some thought, and careful deliberation. As none of us were database experts, coming up with a working schema was very rewarding and worth the effort. The database was able to encompass almost all of our needs. The design also took some thought and consideration, the groups decision was absolutely vital for coming to a final design decision. We are also proud of the fact that we managed to deploy our application using Render.com. None of us had prior knowledge of how to deploy using render, so with careful research and patience we were able to fix bugs and get the app live. 

## What we learned 📚

Collectively, we had new experiences. The main knowledge that was being taught was **UI/UX design🖌️🖼️**, edge cases, **Tailwind CSS🌊**, component attributes, **authentication🔒🔑**, routing⛰️, and version control👾.

## What's Next for Knot Elementary

Our aspiration is to work on this project in various forms - whether individually, in groups, or together again - as we have a wealth of ideas to explore. One of our goals is to implement a homework board, which will assist in keeping track of a child's assignments, and also to incorporate a translation feature that will enable parents and teachers to communicate effectively, even when a language barrier is present.
